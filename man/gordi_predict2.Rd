  repel_label = F,

}
\arguments{
\item{pass}{Object from [gordi_read()] function.}

\item{scaling_coefficient}{Numeric; edits the lengths of predictor arrows. Default value
is `0.9` which means that the predictor arrow will be scaled to 0.9 of
the longest axis displayed in the plot frame.}

\item{label}{Logical; default = F, whether to display label by each point/arrow 
or not. Labels use the `predictor` name for arrows and the combined 
`predictor: level` for centroids. If you want to customize the labels, you can 
with [gordi_label()] function, which overrides this setting.}

\item{show_label}{Logical; default = F. A simplified way to display labels. Overridden by [gordi_label()].}

\item{repel_label}{Logical; repels labels of predictors for better readability.
Default is F. Overridden by [gordi_label()].}

\item{colour}{Colour can be defined statically as word from the [colours()]
list (e.g. 'red'), HEX code (e.g. #5d782e), or number from [palette()] (e.g. 3).
It can also defined dynamically (according to some variable, e.g. elevation
or vegetation type). This variable has to be present in the `env` table and its
name has to be written in "quotation marks". Default colour of arrows is 2, 
and 2 for points.}

\item{fill}{Fill colour for centroid points. Can be defined statically or dynamically (e.g., "score"). Default is 2.}

\item{alpha}{Transparency of symbols/arrows. Numeric value. Default is 1 (for arrows)
and 1 (for points). Can be set statically or dynamically (use "").}

\item{linetype}{Changes type of line used in arrows. See [aes_linetype_size_shape()] for more details. Default is 1 (solid).}

\item{linewidth}{Self-explanatory. Can be numerical value. Used for arrows. See
[aes_linetype_size_shape()] for more details. Default is 1.}

\item{shape}{Shape of centroid points. See [aes_linetype_size_shape()] for more details. Default is 16.}

\item{size}{Size of centroid points. Numeric value. Can be set statically 
or dynamically (e.g., "r2"). Default is 2.}

\item{arrow_size}{Numeric; length of arrow in cm. Default is 0.3 cm.}
}
\value{
The input object `pass` with an updated `plot` element that includes
  predictor arrows and labels.

\description{
THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL VERSION

[gordi_predict()] takes the result of [gordi_read()] and creates plot with
predictor arrows (for continuous variables) and points (for categorical
variables, i.e., centroids). So far, it can work with continuous explanatory 
variables. It also can't display explanatory variables passively (i.e., not 
involved in the ordination model).

There will be a special function for this once, maybe something as
`gordi_corr()`. Similarly to [gordi_species()] and [gordi_sites()],
you can also set a wide range of graphing parameters, such as colour, fill, size,
shape, alpha, stroke, and more traditional ggplot arguments, which can read
both, static and dynamic variable (e.g., 'red' or 'elevation').

data(dune)
data(dune.env)

# --- 1. Example with main effects ---
m1 <- capscale(dune ~ A1 + Management, data = dune.env)
gordi_read(m1, env = dune.env, scaling = 'species', correlation = T) |>
   gordi_species(label = F) |>
   # Predictors (A1: continuous arrow, Management: categorical centroids)
   # Colour is dynamically mapped to the 'score' column (biplot or centroid)
   gordi_predict(scaling_coefficient = 1, colour = 'score', size = 4)

# --- 2. Example with an interaction term ---
# The interaction term will be calculated post-hoc via envfit
